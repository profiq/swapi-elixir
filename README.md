# Elixir SWAPI
The [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/) (SWAPI), reimplemented in Elixir.

_This is currently a work in progress._

## Running the API locally
To start the Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
